000 IMAGE[144] User: vqa2: When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.

In Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?

Linda applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of her snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Bob timed each ride. Linda and Bob calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.
Figure: snowboarding down a hill. Identify the question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer.
A: Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a thin layer of wax or a thick layer of wax?
B: Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?
